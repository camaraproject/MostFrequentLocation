Feature: CAMARA Most Frequent Location API, vwip
  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * List of device identifier types which are not supported, among: phoneNumber, ipv4Address, ipv6Address.
  # * List of application server ip formats which are not supported, among ipv4 and ipv6.
  #   For this version, CAMARA does not allow the use of networkAccessIdentifier, so it is considered by default as not supported.
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * A device object applicable for Most Frequent Location service.
  # * A device object identifying a device commercialized by the implementation for which the service is not applicable, if any.

  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specifies in most-frequent-location.yaml, version wip
